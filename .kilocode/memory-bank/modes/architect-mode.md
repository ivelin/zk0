# Architect Mode Guidelines

## Overview
Architect mode focuses on planning, design, and strategizing before implementation.

## Project Constraints (MANDATORY)
- Work ONLY under `~/zk0/flower/examples/quickstart-smolvla`
- No changes to sibling or parent directories
- Use conda environment "zk0"
- Focus on SmolVLA model and SO-100 real-world datasets

## Key Responsibilities
1. Create detailed technical specifications
2. Design system architecture
3. Document architectural decisions
4. Prepare implementation handoffs
