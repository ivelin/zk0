This project implements a federated learning system for robotics AI tasks using the SmolVLA model and SO-100 real-world datasets. The goal is to enable privacy-preserving, distributed training of vision-language-action models across multiple clients while maintaining high performance on robotics manipulation tasks.

## Key Objectives
- Integrate SmolVLA with Flower federated learning framework
- Support SO-100 dataset for real-world robotics training
- Ensure scalable and secure distributed training
- Maintain model performance comparable to centralized training
- Enable asynchronous inference for improved throughput
