## Work Focus
Completing the Memory Bank structure by creating missing core files: brief.md, product.md, context.md, architecture.md, tech.md, tasks.md. Establishing proper documentation and constraints for the federated learning project with SmolVLA and SO-100 datasets.

## Recent Changes
- Analyzed existing .kilocode files and identified missing Memory Bank components
- Initiated creation of core documentation files to establish project structure
- Set up project constraints and inheritance rules for consistent development

## Current State
Project foundation is being established with comprehensive documentation. The focus remains on integrating SmolVLA with Flower federated learning framework for robotics AI tasks using SO-100 datasets. All development must adhere to the defined constraints and quality standards.
