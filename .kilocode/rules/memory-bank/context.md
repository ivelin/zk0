## Work Focus
Maintaining and updating the Memory Bank to preserve project context and implementation details. The federated learning system with SmolVLA and Flower is fully operational and ready for deployment.

## Recent Changes
- Updated memory bank with comprehensive references to LeRobot, SmolVLA, Hugging Face datasets, Flower framework, and Flower-LeRobot integration examples
- Completed full implementation of SmolVLA federated learning client ([`src/client_app.py`](src/client_app.py)) and server ([`src/server_app.py`](src/server_app.py))
- Integrated comprehensive test suite with pytest covering unit and integration tests
- Established production-ready configuration system with YAML files ([`src/configs/default.yaml`](src/configs/default.yaml), [`src/configs/policy/vla.yaml`](src/configs/policy/vla.yaml))
- Implemented advanced features including video recording and checkpointing
- Updated documentation to reflect production-ready status

## Current State
The project is in production-ready state with complete core infrastructure. SmolVLA federated learning system is fully implemented and tested, supporting SO-100 robotics datasets with Flower framework. All source code paths are documented, test coverage meets requirements, and the system is ready for deployment and community use.
