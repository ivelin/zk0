# Current Context

**Created**: 2025-09-06
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-10
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Author**: Kilo Code

## Work Focus
Maintaining and updating the Memory Bank to preserve project context and implementation details. The federated learning system with SmolVLA and Flower is fully operational and ready for deployment.

## Recent Changes
- **Complete Dataset Configuration System**: Created centralized [`src/configs/datasets.yaml`](src/configs/datasets.yaml) with all client and evaluation datasets
- **Fixed Tolerance Values**: Corrected tolerance_s from 100.0 to 0.0001 (proper 1/fps value) for accurate timestamp validation
- **Doubled Dataset Hotfix**: Implemented automatic detection and correction for datasets with doubled frames (GitHub issue #1875)
- **4th Client Dataset Integration**: Successfully integrated `lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace` as Client 3 for diverse FL training
- **Enhanced Dataset Validation**: Added comprehensive pytest tests in [`tests/unit/test_dataset_validation.py`](tests/unit/test_dataset_validation.py) with timestamp synchronization checks
- **Additional Evaluation Datasets**: Validated and activated 3 additional SO-101 evaluation datasets for cross-platform testing
- **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: Updated [`src/client_app.py`](src/client_app.py) to use YAML configuration for dataset loading
- **Quality Assurance Framework**: Implemented robust validation system that catches data quality issues before training
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Demonstrated compatibility between SO-100 and SO-101 robot platforms in federated learning
- **CRITICAL: MockModel Removal**: Completely removed MockModel class from production code in [`src/client_app.py`](src/client_app.py) and replaced with proper error handling that raises RuntimeError when model loading fails
- **Production Code Quality Standards**: Established explicit guidelines against using mocks in production code - all components must handle real failures gracefully or fail fast with clear error messages

## Current State
The project is in production-ready state with complete core infrastructure. SmolVLA federated learning system is fully implemented and tested, supporting SO-100 robotics datasets with Flower framework. All source code paths are documented, test coverage meets requirements, and the system is ready for deployment and community use.
