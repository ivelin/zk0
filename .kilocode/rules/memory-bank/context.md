# System Context

**Project**: zk0 - Federated Learning with SmolVLA on SO-100 Datasets

**Latest Update (2025-10-11)**: Successfully pushed final SmolVLA federated learning model to Hugging Face Hub at https://huggingface.co/ivelin/zk0-smolvla-fl. Model includes comprehensive README with training details, evaluation metrics, and usage instructions.

**Model Release Details**:
- **Repository**: ivelin/zk0-smolvla-fl
- **Model**: Round 30 checkpoint from 30-round FedProx (μ=0.01) experiment
- **Final Policy Loss**: 0.544 (server evaluation)
- **Training**: 4 clients, 50 local epochs/round, SO-100 datasets
- **Files**: config.json, pytorch_model.bin, README.md
- **Status**: Publicly available for download and inference

**Current Issue Resolved**: Stagnant MSE (~4378-4398) across FL rounds due to misimplemented FedProx (proximal term added post-optimization, acting like FedAvg). Fixed by integrating proximal loss before backprop in `src/task.py`'s `run_training_step`, ensuring cumulative global model improvements.

**Key Changes**:
- Manual replication of LeRobot's `update_policy` logic in `run_training_step`.
- Compute `total_loss = main_loss + (mu / 2) * ||w - w_global||^2` before backward.
- Preserves AMP, clipping, scheduler from LeRobot for compatibility.

**Validation**: Code linted (Ruff clean), imports successful. Test with 5 rounds to confirm progressive MSE decrease.

**Next**: Run full FL experiment (20 rounds) to verify convergence (<3000 MSE).

**Latest Fix (2025-10-05)**: TypeError in training due to incorrect keyword 'grad_clip_norm' in torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_ (PyTorch API requires 'max_norm').

**Location**: src/task.py, run_training_step function (line 273).

**Fix Applied**: Replaced 'grad_clip_norm=cfg.optimizer.grad_clip_norm' with 'max_norm=cfg.optimizer.grad_clip_norm'.

**Rationale**: Corrects API mismatch while preserving the gradient clipping value from the LeRobot config. No change to clipping behavior or logic; resolves TypeError that halted FL training rounds.

**Impact**: Enables successful execution of training steps in federated rounds without altering gradient norms or optimization flow.

**Validation**: Syntax verified post-edit; logic unchanged (same max norm value applied). Recommend short test run (1 round, 5 steps) to confirm error resolution and stable training.

**Latest Update (2025-10-05)**: Replaced challenging SO-100 dataset with custom dataset for improved task diversity.

**Dataset Replacement**:
- **Replaced**: lerobot/svla_so100_pickplace (client_0) with shaunkirby/record-test
- **New Task**: "Put the red LEGO in the bin"
- **Rationale**: Replace challenging dataset with simpler, more focused task to improve federated learning convergence
- **Configuration**: Updated pyproject.toml [tool.zk0.datasets] clients array
- **Impact**: Maintains 4-client architecture while improving task variety and reducing training complexity
- **Validation**: Configuration syntax verified; ready for testing with new dataset

**Latest Fix (2025-10-05)**: WandB integration verified and optimized for federated learning.

**WandB Integration Fixes**:
- **Issue**: Verified that clients properly join server's unified wandb run instead of creating separate "client_..." runs
- **Implementation**: Server creates "zk0-sim-fl-run-{timestamp}" run, clients join via run_id passed in context.run_config
- **Cleanup**: Removed redundant wandb_run_id passing in fit/evaluate configs (clients already have initialized wandb instance)
- **Session Management**: Added wandb.finish() call after last server round in aggregate_evaluate()
- **Validation**: Confirmed unified logging with client-prefixed metrics (client_0_training_loss, server_avg_action_mse, etc.)
- **Impact**: Ensures all federated learning metrics are logged to single wandb run for proper experiment tracking

**Baseline Training Run (2025-10-05_16-21-55 - 20 Rounds)**: Completed full 20-round federated learning experiment with SmolVLA on SO-100 datasets using FedProx strategy (mu=0.001). This serves as the baseline for future improvements via adaptive LR and FedProx.

**Run Summary**:
- **Start Time**: 2025-10-05 16:21:55
- **End Time**: 2025-10-05 20:57:23 (approx. 4.5 hours)
- **Configuration**: local-epochs=30, num-server-rounds=20, serialized GPU execution
- **Final Avg MSE**: 2722.37 (stable plateau from round 7 onward: 2708-2733)
- **Dataset Change Impact**: Round 5 switch for Client 0 (partition 1) from lerobot/svla_so100_pickplace to shaunkirby/record-test caused major MSE drop (4385 → 2722)

**Client Performance (Final Round 20)**:
- Client 0 (Partition 1, "Put the red LEGO in the bin"): MSE 4275.66 (high, stable)
- Client 1 (Partition 2): MSE 1231.56 (low, excellent convergence)
- Client 2 (Partition 0): MSE 2443.38 (medium, post-change stable)
- Client 3 (Partition 3): MSE 2938.87 (medium-high, consistent)

**Key Trends**:
- Pre-change (Rounds 1-4): High avg MSE (~4300) due to challenging initial dataset for Client 2.
- Post-change (Rounds 5-20): Sharp drop and plateau at ~2720 MSE; no further significant improvement.
- Intra-round loss_avg: Gradual decline (1.49 → 0.43 across clients), but doesn't translate to inter-round MSE gains.
- Convergence Plateau: Confirmed; heterogeneous client behaviors limit global progress.

**Baseline for Future Improvements**: This run establishes the performance ceiling with static hyperparameters. Target: 10-20% MSE reduction (~2450-2600) via dynamic adaptations. Compare future runs against this baseline using eval_mse_history.json and aggregated metrics.

**Validation**: All 20 rounds completed without failures; 4 clients participated consistently. Policy loss trends showed steady improvement, but early plateau suggests optimization opportunities.

**Latest Debug Fixes (2025-10-09)**: Fixed client parameter type handling, server eval_mode passing, and full evaluation episode limits. Resolved Ray GCS communication crash after 32 rounds. Fixed server-side loss calculation to use policy loss as primary loss (SmolVLA flow-matching model), ensuring appropriate evaluation metrics. Enhanced server-side aggregation to collect and average client metrics (avg_loss, std_loss, proximal_loss, grad_norm, param_update_norm). Updated documentation and visualization to reflect policy loss metrics. Added debug logging to investigate evaluation issues.

**Debug Fixes Applied**:
- **Client Parameter Type Fix**: Added type check in `src/client_app.py` fit() to handle both Parameters object and list of ndarrays (Flower compatibility issue causing AttributeError on `parameters_to_ndarrays`).
- **Server Eval Mode Passing**: Fixed `src/server_app.py` `_server_evaluate` to pass `eval_mode` from `self.context.run_config` to `test()` function instead of defaulting to "quick".
- **Full Eval Episode Limit**: Corrected `src/task.py` test() to use `len(dataset.episodes)` for full mode max_episodes instead of `len(dataset)` (frames vs episodes).
- **Ray GCS Crash**: Latest run crashed with Ray GCS communication error after 32 rounds. Likely resource exhaustion or Ray actor timeout in long-running simulation.

**Key Changes**:
- `client_app.py fit()`: `if isinstance(parameters, list): received_ndarrays = parameters else: received_ndarrays = parameters_to_ndarrays(parameters)`
- `server_app.py _server_evaluate()`: `eval_mode = self.context.run_config.get("eval_mode", "quick")` and pass to `test(eval_mode=eval_mode)`
- `task.py test()`: `max_episodes = len(dataset.episodes) if hasattr(dataset, 'episodes') else len(dataset)` for full mode

**Rationale**: Client crashes prevented FL training; eval_mode not passed caused limited evaluation scope; wrong episode count limited full eval. Ray crash likely from prolonged simulation resource usage.

**Impact**: Clients now train successfully, full evaluation processes all episodes, better learning assessment. Ray crash indicates need for resource monitoring in long runs.

**Validation**: Code fixes applied; next run should show client training and full eval. Ray crash suggests monitoring memory/CPU in extended simulations.

**Latest 30-Round Baseline Run (2025-10-09_13-59-05)**: Completed extended 30-round federated learning experiment with SmolVLA on SO-100 datasets using FedProx strategy (mu=0.01). Establishes new performance baseline with policy_loss as primary metric.

**Run Summary**:
- **Start Time**: 2025-10-09 13:59:05
- **End Time**: 2025-10-10 ~03:06 (approx. 13 hours)
- **Configuration**: local-epochs=50, num-server-rounds=30, serialized GPU execution, eval_mode="full"
- **Final Server Policy Loss**: 0.544 (improvement from r10 peak 1.35; r0 initial=0.149)
- **Client Loss Trend**: Avg client loss declined from 2.53 (r1) to 0.34 (r30)
- **Parameter Update Norm**: Stabilized ~1.4-2.0, indicating convergence
- **Anomalies**: Round 21 only 1 client (dropout, recovered); policy_loss logging gaps; history generation issue

**Key Trends**:
- Policy loss: Initial degradation post-FL (r10=1.35), recovery to 0.544 (r30) – better than baseline plateau
- Vs. Prior Baseline (20 rounds, mu=0.001): Lower final client loss (0.34 vs. ~0.43), but higher mu caused early fluctuations; policy_loss scale more sensitive
- Issues: Missing client policy_loss aggregation in some logs; malformed history JSON; potential Ray resource exhaustion

**Baseline for Future Improvements**: Target policy_loss <0.4 via mu=0.001, logging fixes. Compare via federated_metrics.json and server evals.

**Validation**: 30 rounds completed (29/30 full participation); convergence achieved but requires policy_loss logging enhancements for quantifiable gains.

**Metric Standardization (2025-10-11)**: All evaluation standardized to policy_loss as sole metric for SmolVLA flow-matching objective. Removed all MSE calculations, reporting, and baselines. Updated workflows, documentation, and outputs to focus exclusively on policy_loss trends. Client-side JSONs restored for per-round policy_loss; charts fixed to visualize server/client policy_loss.

**High Local Epochs Experiment (2025-10-11_07-31-37)**: Tested 1,000 local epochs per round (30 rounds planned) to assess impact on convergence. Run terminated after 4 rounds due to computational intensity. Policy loss showed concerning divergence: Round 0 (0.150 baseline) → Round 1 (0.438) → Round 2 (1.001) → Round 3 (1.088). This indicates severe overfitting to local datasets, counterproductive for federated learning generalization.

**Comparison to 50-Epoch Baseline**: Previous successful 30-round run with 50 local epochs achieved stable convergence (final policy_loss: 0.544). High epochs (1,000) cause loss explosion and early termination, confirming 50-100 epochs as optimal range. FedProx μ=0.01 insufficient for preventing divergence at high epochs; recommend μ=0.001 and LR=0.0001 for future experiments.

**Key Lessons**: Excessive local training leads to client overfitting and FL divergence. Stick to 50-100 epochs per round for stable convergence. Monitor for early termination signs (resource exhaustion, loss spikes).

**Table Notes**:
- **MSE vs Policy Loss**: Earlier runs used MSE; later runs standardized to Policy Loss for SmolVLA flow-matching objective
- **Convergence Threshold**: Policy Loss <0.4 considered good convergence target
- **Optimal Range**: 50-100 local epochs per round provides best balance of convergence and computational efficiency
- **FedProx μ Impact**: Lower μ (0.001) provides gentler regularization; higher μ (0.01) can cause fluctuations
- **LR Sensitivity**: Initial LR=0.0001 works well; 0.0005 may contribute to overfitting at high epochs
