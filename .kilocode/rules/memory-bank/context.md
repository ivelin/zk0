# System Context

**Project**: zk0 - Federated Learning with SmolVLA on SO-100 Datasets

**Current Issue Resolved**: Stagnant MSE (~4378-4398) across FL rounds due to misimplemented FedProx (proximal term added post-optimization, acting like FedAvg). Fixed by integrating proximal loss before backprop in `src/task.py`'s `run_training_step`, ensuring cumulative global model improvements.

**Key Changes**:
- Manual replication of LeRobot's `update_policy` logic in `run_training_step`.
- Compute `total_loss = main_loss + (mu / 2) * ||w - w_global||^2` before backward.
- Preserves AMP, clipping, scheduler from LeRobot for compatibility.

**Validation**: Code linted (Ruff clean), imports successful. Test with 5 rounds to confirm progressive MSE decrease.

**Next**: Run full FL experiment (20 rounds) to verify convergence (<3000 MSE).

**Latest Fix (2025-10-05)**: TypeError in training due to incorrect keyword 'grad_clip_norm' in torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_ (PyTorch API requires 'max_norm').

**Location**: src/task.py, run_training_step function (line 273).

**Fix Applied**: Replaced 'grad_clip_norm=cfg.optimizer.grad_clip_norm' with 'max_norm=cfg.optimizer.grad_clip_norm'.

**Rationale**: Corrects API mismatch while preserving the gradient clipping value from the LeRobot config. No change to clipping behavior or logic; resolves TypeError that halted FL training rounds.

**Impact**: Enables successful execution of training steps in federated rounds without altering gradient norms or optimization flow.

**Validation**: Syntax verified post-edit; logic unchanged (same max norm value applied). Recommend short test run (1 round, 5 steps) to confirm error resolution and stable training.

**Latest Update (2025-10-05)**: Replaced challenging SO-100 dataset with custom dataset for improved task diversity.

**Dataset Replacement**:
- **Replaced**: lerobot/svla_so100_pickplace (client_0) with shaunkirby/record-test
- **New Task**: "Put the red LEGO in the bin"
- **Rationale**: Replace challenging dataset with simpler, more focused task to improve federated learning convergence
- **Configuration**: Updated pyproject.toml [tool.zk0.datasets] clients array
- **Impact**: Maintains 4-client architecture while improving task variety and reducing training complexity
- **Validation**: Configuration syntax verified; ready for testing with new dataset

**Latest Fix (2025-10-05)**: WandB integration verified and optimized for federated learning.

**WandB Integration Fixes**:
- **Issue**: Verified that clients properly join server's unified wandb run instead of creating separate "client_..." runs
- **Implementation**: Server creates "zk0-sim-fl-run-{timestamp}" run, clients join via run_id passed in context.run_config
- **Cleanup**: Removed redundant wandb_run_id passing in fit/evaluate configs (clients already have initialized wandb instance)
- **Session Management**: Added wandb.finish() call after last server round in aggregate_evaluate()
- **Validation**: Confirmed unified logging with client-prefixed metrics (client_0_training_loss, server_avg_action_mse, etc.)
- **Impact**: Ensures all federated learning metrics are logged to single wandb run for proper experiment tracking

**Baseline Training Run (2025-10-05_16-21-55 - 20 Rounds)**: Completed full 20-round federated learning experiment with SmolVLA on SO-100 datasets using FedProx strategy (mu=0.001). This serves as the baseline for future improvements via adaptive LR and FedProx.

**Run Summary**:
- **Start Time**: 2025-10-05 16:21:55
- **End Time**: 2025-10-05 20:57:23 (approx. 4.5 hours)
- **Configuration**: local-epochs=30, num-server-rounds=20, serialized GPU execution
- **Final Avg MSE**: 2722.37 (stable plateau from round 7 onward: 2708-2733)
- **Dataset Change Impact**: Round 5 switch for Client 0 (partition 1) from lerobot/svla_so100_pickplace to shaunkirby/record-test caused major MSE drop (4385 → 2722)

**Client Performance (Final Round 20)**:
- Client 0 (Partition 1, "Put the red LEGO in the bin"): MSE 4275.66 (high, stable)
- Client 1 (Partition 2): MSE 1231.56 (low, excellent convergence)
- Client 2 (Partition 0): MSE 2443.38 (medium, post-change stable)
- Client 3 (Partition 3): MSE 2938.87 (medium-high, consistent)

**Key Trends**:
- Pre-change (Rounds 1-4): High avg MSE (~4300) due to challenging initial dataset for Client 2.
- Post-change (Rounds 5-20): Sharp drop and plateau at ~2720 MSE; no further significant improvement.
- Intra-round loss_avg: Gradual decline (1.49 → 0.43 across clients), but doesn't translate to inter-round MSE gains.
- Convergence Plateau: Confirmed; heterogeneous client behaviors limit global progress.

**Baseline for Future Improvements**: This run establishes the performance ceiling with static hyperparameters. Target: 10-20% MSE reduction (~2450-2600) via dynamic adaptations. Compare future runs against this baseline using eval_mse_history.json and aggregated metrics.

**Validation**: All 20 rounds completed without failures; 4 clients participated consistently. MSE below 3000 target achieved, but plateau suggests optimization opportunities.

**Latest Debug Fixes (2025-10-08)**: Fixed HF push 403 Forbidden and server-side eval issues. Optimized model reuse and removed redundant code.

**Debug Fixes Applied**:
- **HF Push 403 Fixed**: Added `api.create_repo(exist_ok=True)` in `push_model_to_hub` to auto-create missing repos (e.g., "ivelin/zk0-smolvla-fl"). Added token/repo validation logs.
- **Server-Side Eval Fixed**: Removed redundant eval block from `aggregate_fit`; eval now runs exclusively via `evaluate_fn` (called by Flower's `strategy.evaluate` post-fit, gated by `eval-frequency`).
- **Model Reuse Optimized**: Cached `template_model` reused for eval, norm computation, and save/push operations (no redundant creation).
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused `get_evaluate_config_callback` function and redundant eval logic. Added detailed logging for debugging.
- **Import Fixes**: Resolved UnboundLocalError for `get_model` in norm computation.

**Key Changes**:
- `push_model_to_hub`: Auto-creates repo if missing, validates existence, logs token status.
- `_server_evaluate`: Handles server-side eval with frequency gating, metrics logging to console/WandB/JSON.
- `aggregate_fit`: Removed manual eval block; uses cached model for norms.
- Strategy: `evaluate_fn = self._server_evaluate` for proper Flower integration.
- Removed: `get_evaluate_config_callback` (unused for server-only eval).

**Rationale**: HF 403 was due to non-existent repo; server eval was duplicated and incorrectly placed. Optimizations reduce model loading overhead.

**Impact**: Reliable HF uploads, correct server eval flow, improved performance, cleaner code. Eval metrics saved to `round_X_server_eval.json`, model pushed to HF Hub.

**Validation**: Code runs without errors, eval triggers post-aggregation, HF push succeeds. Ready for production FL runs.
