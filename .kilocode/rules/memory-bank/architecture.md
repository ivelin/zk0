## Overview
The system implements a federated learning architecture using the Flower framework with SmolVLA models for robotics AI tasks. The architecture follows a client-server model where multiple clients train models locally on their private datasets and a central server coordinates the federated learning process. With PEFT/LoRA integration via Hugging Face PEFT library, clients load the base SmolVLA policy, apply low-rank adapters to action expert attention layers only (3.4M adapters, 96.6% efficiency), train adapters only (trainable params 5M with rank=16, alpha=32), and exchange adapter state_dicts (~1MB payloads) while freezing vision (86M SigLIP) and text (204M SmolLM2) models, enabling memory-efficient federated updates vs. full 453M model fine-tuning.

## Core Components

### Client Layer
- **SmolVLA Models**: Vision-language-action models for robotics manipulation
- **SmolVLA Architecture**: Vision (86M frozen SigLIP) + Text (204M frozen SmolLM2) + Action Expert (101M trainable)
- **LoRA Adapters**: Low-rank adapters added to action expert attention layers only (3.4M adapters, 96.6% efficiency); trainable params 5M; vision/text untouched
- **Local Datasets**: SO-100 real-world robotics datasets
- **Training Logic**: Local model training with privacy preservation; optimizer targets adapters only; AMP for mixed precision
- **Parameter Exchange**: Secure communication with central server; sends adapter state_dict only (~1MB payloads)

### Server Layer
- **Aggregation Engine**: Flower framework for parameter aggregation
- **LoRA Aggregation**: Custom LoRAFedAvg strategy averages A/B matrices from client adapters, merges into base model, broadcasts merged adapters
- **Federated Strategies**: FedAvg and FedProx algorithms (extended for LoRA)
- **Model Distribution**: Broadcasting updated global models/adapters to clients
- **Orchestration**: Managing federated learning rounds and client coordination

### Communication Layer
- **Secure Channels**: Encrypted parameter transmission
- **Asynchronous Updates**: Support for clients joining/leaving dynamically
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Efficient parameter compression and transmission (LoRA reduces comms by 90-95%)

## Technical Decisions

### Framework Selection
- **Flower Framework**: Chosen for its simplicity, scalability, and PyTorch integration
- **SmolVLA Integration**: Direct compatibility with LeRobot ecosystem
- **SO-100 Datasets**: Standardized robotics data format
- **PEFT/LoRA**: Selected for parameter-efficient fine-tuning; targets attention/action layers to preserve pre-trained knowledge while adapting to robotics tasks; rank=16, alpha=32 for balance of efficiency/performance

### Architecture Patterns
- **Client-Server Model**: Standard federated learning topology
- **Parameter Server**: Centralized aggregation for efficiency
- **Modular Design**: Separable client and server components; LoRA wrapping post-policy loading maintains LeRobot API compliance
- **Adapter-Only Exchange**: Clients train/merge adapters locally; server handles full model merging to minimize bandwidth

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support for multiple clients
- **Resource Management**: GPU allocation and memory optimization (LoRA reduces peak VRAM to ~6-8GB)
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handling client failures and network issues

## Training Strategy

### Federated Learning Setup
The system implements a carefully designed federated learning strategy to ensure robust, privacy-preserving training of SmolVLA models across distributed clients. With LoRA, training focuses on adapters for efficiency.

#### Client Task Assignments
Each client is assigned a unique robotics manipulation task to prevent data overlap and ensure diverse skill learning. See [`src/configs/datasets.yaml`](src/configs/datasets.yaml) for complete client dataset configuration including:
- **4 validated clients** with diverse robotics manipulation tasks
- **Dataset sizes and validation status** for each client
- **Train/eval episode splits** for proper federated learning setup
- **Quality assurance indicators** (CLEAN vs HOTFIX APPLIED)

#### Data Quality and Uniqueness Requirements
- **High-Quality Datasets**: All datasets must contain clear, well-annotated episodes
- **Unique Tasks**: No task overlap between clients to ensure diverse skill acquisition
- **Fresh Data**: None of the datasets used for training the base SmolVLA model
- **Evaluation Isolation**: Separate evaluation datasets never seen during training

#### Evaluation Strategy
- **Client-Specific Evaluation**: Each client evaluated on their assigned task
- **Cross-Task Evaluation**: Global model evaluated on all client tasks
- **Unseen Task Evaluation**: Additional evaluation on completely novel SO-100/SO-101 tasks
- **Data Leak Prevention**: Strict validation to ensure no evaluation data in training sets

#### Server Evaluation Datasets (Unseen Tasks)
The server evaluates the global model on all client tasks as well as additional unseen tasks to verify generalization capabilities. See [`src/configs/datasets.yaml`](src/configs/datasets.yaml) for the complete list of validated evaluation datasets including:
- **SO-101 cross-platform datasets** for generalization testing
- **Research laboratory scenarios** for specialized task validation
- **Comprehensive test suites** for thorough evaluation
- **Real-time performance datasets** for inference validation

#### Evaluation Metrics
- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed episodes
- **Action Accuracy**: Precision of predicted vs. ground truth actions
- **Generalization Score**: Performance on unseen evaluation tasks
- **Cross-Task Performance**: Average performance across all evaluation datasets

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Server loads base SmolVLA policy and broadcasts initial adapters (or full model) to clients via Flower parameters
2. **Task Assignment**: Each client receives unique SO-100/SO-101 task dataset (e.g., pick-place, air hockey) from configs/datasets.yaml
3. **Local Training**: Clients wrap base policy with LoRA (PEFT LoraConfig: task_type=SEQ_2_SEQ_LM, target_modules=["self_attn.q_proj","self_attn.k_proj","self_attn.v_proj","self_attn.o_proj"], modules_to_save=["action_out_proj","state_proj"]), train adapters using MSE loss on actions with AMP/GradScaler for mixed precision
4. **Adapter Upload**: Clients save adapters via policy.save_pretrained() and serialize only LoRA state_dict (A/B matrices) for upload to server (~1MB per client)
5. **LoRA Aggregation**: Server implements custom LoRAFedAvg strategy (extends FedAvg): averages client A/B matrices separately, merges into base policy using PeftModel, serializes merged adapters for broadcast
6. **Model Update**: Server broadcasts merged adapters (subsequent rounds) or full model (initial round) via Flower Message API
7. **Cross-Evaluation**: Merged global model evaluated on client tasks (client-side) and unseen SO-101 datasets (server-side) using SmolVLAEvaluator for action MSE and success rate
8. **Iteration**: Process repeats for configurable rounds (default 10) with per-round logging of trainable params, memory usage, and MSE via Loguru/WandB

## Security Architecture

- **Privacy Preservation**: No raw data leaves client environments
- **Encrypted Communication**: TLS for all client-server interactions
- **Access Control**: Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for compliance

## Performance Considerations

### SmolVLA Performance
- **SO-100 Success Rate**: 78.3% (with community pretraining)
- **SO-101 Generalization**: Strong transfer capabilities

- **Fault Tolerance**: Handling client failures and network issues
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Efficient parameter compression and transmission (LoRA: ~1MB payloads, 99.75% bandwidth reduction)

## Improvement Suggestions from Pusht Example Analysis

Based on analysis of the Flower LeRobot pusht example and FlowerTune for PEFT/LoRA, the following improvements are implemented/pending for zk0 architecture:

1. **Modular Task Separation**: Adopted separate task.py for model initialization (load_lora_policy), training (LoRA-aware loop with AMP), and evaluation logic to improve organization, similar to the example.
2. **Standardized Partitioning**: Integrated Flower Datasets with GroupedNaturalIdPartitioner for episode partitioning alongside zk0's multi-repo support.
3. **Gym Integration for Evaluation**: Pending: Add gym-based rollout evaluation with video rendering for standardized testing, complementing existing SmolVLAEvaluator.
4. **Config Flexibility**: Enhanced YAML config (vla.yaml) for PEFT (rank, alpha, targets) and image transforms; supports online training parameters via pyproject.toml.
5. **GPU and AMP Support**: Implemented Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) and GradScaler in training loop for improved efficiency (PEFT/HF compatible).
6. **Output Management**: Standardized output directories for models/adapters, evaluations, videos, and LoRA-specific metrics (e.g., trainable_params.json) across clients and server.
7. **LoRA-Specific**: Custom LoRAFedAvg for adapter aggregation (average A/B, merge on server per FlowerTune); client-side save_pretrained for ~1MB payloads.
8. **Runtime Error Fixes**: Identified target_modules configuration mismatch, forward pass compatibility issues, and AMP integration problems; comprehensive fix plan created for successful PEFT FL training.

These changes align zk0 with LeRobot/FlowerTune best practices while maintaining SmolVLA/LoRA focus for efficient FL. Runtime error analysis complete with targeted fixes for production deployment.
