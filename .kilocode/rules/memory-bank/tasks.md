# Repetitive Task Workflows

**Created**: 2025-09-06
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14
**Version**: 1.0.2
**Author**: Kilo Code

## Latest Update (2025-10-29)
**✅ CI Workflow Consolidation**: Consolidated separate unit and integration test jobs into a single matrix job for cleaner GitHub Actions workflow. Removed redundant tee piping, test-output.log artifacts, and standardized on Python 3.10. Fixed lerobot installation for CI compatibility. Version bumped to 0.3.11.

**✅ Enhanced HF Model Push Workflow**: Implemented comprehensive HF Hub push enhancements including rich model cards, git tagging, dynamic README generation, and simulation mode detection. New `push_model_to_hub_enhanced()` function extracts data from configs/JSON outputs, generates detailed model cards with hyperparameters/datasets/metrics/insights, creates local/HF git tags, and handles edge cases. Updated memory bank and added comprehensive unit tests. Version bumped to 0.3.7.

**✅ Standalone Model Push Module Migration**: Migrated standalone push_to_hf.py to src/zk0/push_to_hf.py module for proper package integration. Updated imports to use absolute package paths (zk0.server.server_utils, zk0.utils), removed shebang for module execution, added console_scripts entry point in pyproject.toml, updated README.md documentation, and removed standalone file. Module can now be executed via `python -m zk0.push_to_hf` with full functionality preserved.

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Aggregate Fit Parameter Safety Fix
**Last performed:** 2025-10-14
**Context:** Fixed critical bug where aggregate_fit() could return None parameters, causing `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object` in Flower's server unpacking.

**Files modified:** `src/server_app.py`

**Steps:**
1. **Issue Detection**: Tiny training runs crashed with `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object` in Flower server unpacking
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: aggregate_fit() could return None for aggregated_parameters in edge cases (early stopping, no clients, aggregation failures)
3. **Fix Implementation**: Added critical safety check at end of aggregate_fit():
   ```python
   # CRITICAL: Always return valid parameters tuple to prevent Flower unpacking errors
   # This fixes the "cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object" error
   if aggregated_parameters is None:
       logger.warning(
           f"⚠️ Server: No parameters aggregated for round {server_round}, returning initial parameters"
       )
       aggregated_parameters = self.initial_parameters

   return aggregated_parameters, metrics
   ```
4. **Parameter Storage**: Ensured `self.initial_parameters` is available as fallback (stored in __init__)
5. **Validation**: Fixed code ensures Flower always receives valid `(parameters, metrics)` tuple
6. **Testing**: Next tiny training run should complete without unpacking errors

**Benefits:**
- Stable training that doesn't crash Flower server
- Reliable parameter handling for all run lengths
- Maintains model quality by returning best available parameters
- Prevents data loss from unexpected crashes during training

## Consolidated Metrics Implementation
**Last performed:** 2025-10-13
**Context:** Consolidated client metrics into server evaluation files for unified reporting and analysis.

**Files modified:** `src/server_app.py`, `src/client_app.py`, `pyproject.toml`

**Steps:**
1. **Version Increment**: Updated project version from 0.1.15 to 0.1.19 in pyproject.toml
2. **Server Aggregation Storage**: Modified `aggregate_fit()` in server_app.py to store individual client metrics (client_id, loss, fedprox_loss, grad_norm, param_hash, dataset_name) in `self.last_client_metrics`
3. **Server Eval Consolidation**: Updated `_server_evaluate()` to include both `aggregated_client_metrics` and `individual_client_metrics` in round_X_server_eval.json files
4. **Client Dataset Reporting**: Added `dataset_name` to client fit() metrics in client_app.py for server-side aggregation
5. **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced metrics descriptions in server eval JSON to explain aggregated and individual client metrics

**Benefits:**
- Unified metrics reporting in server evaluation files
- Complete federated learning analysis from single location
- Dataset-aware client identification and tracking
- Enhanced debugging and performance monitoring
- Simplified post-run analysis and reporting

**✅ Added Parameter Type Handling and Eval Mode Fixes Workflow**: Documented fixes for client parameter type compatibility, server eval_mode passing, and full evaluation episode limits to resolve federated learning crashes and limited evaluation scope.

**✅ Added Server-Side Loss Calculation Fix Workflow**: Fixed server evaluation to use policy loss as primary loss (SmolVLA flow-matching model), ensuring appropriate evaluation metrics

**✅ Added Client Metrics Aggregation Fix Workflow**: Enhanced server-side aggregation to collect and average client metrics (avg_loss, std_loss, proximal_loss, grad_norm, param_update_norm) for proper federated learning monitoring

**✅ Added Documentation Update Workflow**: Updated README.md, visualization.py, server_app.py, and tests to reflect policy loss metrics, including chart generation, file names, and metric descriptions

**✅ Added LR/MU Scheduling Enhancement Workflow**: Implemented advanced LR/MU scheduling with warm restarts, per-client adaptive LR boosts, dynamic mu adjustment, and spike detection. Added comprehensive unit tests, documentation updates, and memory bank entries. Targets <0.15 server policy loss with 100% client engagement.

## HF Push Workflow
**Last performed:** 2025-10-28
**Context:** Complete checkpoint directory-based HF Hub push system for SmolVLA federated learning models. Server creates full HF-ready directories, standalone script validates and uploads them.

**Prerequisites:**
- Conda environment "zk0" activated: `conda run -n zk0`
- HF token set in `.env`: `HF_TOKEN=your_token_here`
- Checkpoint directory with required files (model.safetensors, config.json, etc.)

**Files modified:**
- `src/server/server_utils.py` - `save_model_checkpoint()`, `push_model_to_hub_enhanced()`, `save_and_push_model()`
- `src/push_to_hf.py` - Updated to accept checkpoint directories
- `tests/unit/test_server_utils.py` - Added tests for directory creation and push logic
- `README.md` - Updated with checkpoint directory structure
- `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md` - Documented workflow

**Steps:**
1. **Server Checkpoint Creation**: `save_model_checkpoint()` creates `checkpoint_round_N/` directory with:
   - `model.safetensors` - Model weights in safetensors format
   - `config.json` - Model configuration from template
   - `README.md` - Auto-generated model card with hyperparameters, datasets, metrics, insights
   - `metrics.json` - Aggregated and individual client metrics
   - Base model files (tokenizer.json, preprocessor.json, etc.) copied from HF cache

2. **Server Push Logic**: `save_and_push_model()` calls `save_model_checkpoint()` (returning directory path), then `push_model_to_hub_enhanced(checkpoint_dir, repo_id)` for final round

3. **Standalone Push**: `conda run -n zk0 python -m zk0.push_to_hf /path/to/checkpoint_dir --repo-id user/model` validates required files and uploads entire directory

4. **HF Hub Upload**: `push_model_to_hub_enhanced()` uses `api.upload_folder()` to upload complete directory, creates git tags, handles cleanup

**Benefits:**
- **No Shape Mismatches**: Server creates directories with correct template/conversion logic
- **Complete Metadata**: Every checkpoint has full README, metrics, and all required HF files
- **Session Caching**: Base model files cached per server session using HF Hub cache
- **Standalone Simplicity**: Script just validates and uploads pre-built directories
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing safetensors saves preserved; new directories for HF-ready checkpoints

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for `save_model_checkpoint()` and `push_model_to_hub_enhanced()`
- Integration test: Run tiny FL training, verify checkpoint directory creation and HF push
- Standalone test: Push saved directory manually, verify HF repo contents

## Prepare for Commit Workflow
