# Client Setup Workflow

## Overview
This workflow provides a step-by-step guide for configuring and deploying client nodes in the federated learning system using SmolVLA and SO-100 datasets.

## Prerequisites
- Conda environment "zk0" activated
- Flower client dependencies installed
- Local SO-100 dataset available
- SmolVLA model access
- Network connectivity to Flower server
- Hardware resources (GPU/CPU) allocated

## Steps

### 1. Dependency Installation
- Install all required Python packages
- Verify Flower framework compatibility
- Ensure SmolVLA and LeRobot dependencies are met

### 2. Flower Client Initialization
- Create NumPyClient instance for SmolVLA
- Configure client parameters and settings
- Set up client identification and authentication

### 3. Dataset Partitioning
- Load local SO-100 dataset partition
- Apply data preprocessing and normalization
- Configure data loaders for efficient training

### 4. Model Configuration
- Load SmolVLA model architecture
- Set model parameters and hyperparameters
- Configure training settings for federated learning

### 5. Server Connection
- Establish secure connection to Flower server
- Validate TLS and authentication setup
- Confirm server availability and compatibility

### 6. Training Loop
- Participate in federated learning rounds
- Execute local training on partitioned data
- Monitor training progress and convergence

### 7. Parameter Synchronization
- Send local model updates to server
- Receive aggregated global model updates
- Synchronize parameters securely

### 8. Logging and Monitoring
- Track training metrics and performance
- Log client activity and errors
- Monitor resource usage and communication efficiency

## Checkpoints
- [ ] All dependencies installed and verified
- [ ] Flower client initialized successfully
- [ ] SO-100 dataset partitioned and loaded
- [ ] SmolVLA model configured correctly
- [ ] Server connection established
- [ ] Training loop executing without errors
- [ ] Parameter synchronization working
- [ ] Logging and monitoring active
