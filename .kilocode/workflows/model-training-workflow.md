# Model Training Workflow

## Overview
This workflow outlines the process for training SmolVLA models locally on SO-100 datasets within the federated learning framework.

## Prerequisites
- Conda environment "zk0" activated
- SmolVLA model access from Hugging Face
- SO-100 dataset downloaded and available
- Sufficient GPU/CPU resources for training
- Training configuration parameters defined

## Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- Activate conda environment "zk0"
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Set up GPU acceleration if available

### 2. Model Loading
- Load SmolVLA model from Hugging Face hub
- Initialize model parameters and architecture
- Configure model for local training

### 3. Dataset Preparation
- Load and preprocess SO-100 dataset
- Apply data augmentations and normalization
- Partition dataset for efficient training

### 4. Training Configuration
- Set hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
- Configure optimizer and loss functions
- Define training parameters and checkpoints

### 5. Local Training
- Execute training loop on local hardware
- Monitor training progress and metrics
- Save model checkpoints periodically

### 6. Parameter Extraction
- Extract trained model parameters
- Prepare updates for federated aggregation
- Validate parameter integrity

### 7. Server Communication
- Send model updates to central Flower server
- Handle secure parameter transmission
- Confirm successful upload

### 8. Model Update
- Receive aggregated global model from server
- Update local model with federated improvements
- Validate updated model performance

### 9. Validation
- Test updated model on validation set
- Measure performance metrics and accuracy
- Document training results and insights
