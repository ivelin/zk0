# Deployment Workflow

## Overview
This workflow outlines the process for deploying the federated learning system with SmolVLA models and SO-100 datasets to production environments.

## Prerequisites
- Production environment access
- Conda environment "zk0" configured
- All configuration files validated
- Security certificates and keys prepared
- Hardware resources allocated (GPU, memory, storage)
- Network infrastructure ready

## Steps

### 1. Environment Validation
- Verify conda environment "zk0" is active
- Check all dependencies and versions
- Validate Python and framework compatibility

### 2. Configuration Review
- Review all configuration files (YAML, JSON)
- Validate SmolVLA and Flower settings
- Confirm dataset paths and access permissions

### 3. Security Setup
- Configure TLS certificates for secure communication
- Set up authentication and authorization
- Enable encryption for parameter transmission

### 4. Resource Allocation
- Allocate GPU resources for model training
- Configure memory and storage limits
- Set up distributed computing resources if needed

### 5. Service Startup
- Launch Flower server with production configuration
- Start client nodes in distributed environment
- Initialize federated learning orchestration

### 6. Monitoring Setup
- Configure logging and alerting systems
- Set up performance monitoring dashboards
- Enable automated health checks and notifications

### 7. Health Checks
- Validate server-client connectivity
- Test federated learning round execution
- Verify model performance and convergence
- Confirm security and privacy compliance
