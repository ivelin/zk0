zk0 is an Open Source humanoid built collaboratively by a community of contributors of code, compute and data. Main building blocks:
- [HuggingFace LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot) for the Open Source 3D printed robot parts and end-to-end vision language action models.
- [Flower](https://flower.ai/) for collaborative training of AI models
- [EZKL](https://ezkl.xyz/) for zero knowledge proofs of contributed model checkpoints trained on private data.

# Why?

Why do we need yet another humanoid project? 
As of 2024 AI technology has [advanced enough to speculate](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1786367513137233933) that within a decade most people will have their own humanoid buddy.
[Today's leading proprietary humanoid](https://x.com/Tesla_Optimus/status/1846294753144361371) is trained on [100,000 GPU farm](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus) with real world data collected from millions of cars labeled by able human drivers. 
This is an enormous scale of compute and data that is hard to compete with as a centrazlied entity. However it would be interesting to see if a decentralized approach might produce useful results over time.
On the chance that proprietary humanoids ever go rogue, it would be nice to have open source alternatives.
