Community trained humanoid based on:
- [HuggingFace LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot) for the 3D printed robot parts and base Vision Language Action model.
- [Flower](https://flower.ai/) for collaborative training of AI models
- [EZKL](https://ezkl.xyz/) for zero knowledge proofs of contributed model checkpoints trained on private data.

# Why?

[Today's leading proprietary humanoid](https://x.com/Tesla_Optimus/status/1846294753144361371) is trained on 100,000 GPU farm with real world data collected from millions of cars labeled by able human drivers. 
This is an enormous scale of compute and data that is hard to compete with as a centrazlied entity. However it would be interesting to see if a decentralized approach might produce useful results over time.
On the chance that proprietary humanoids ever go rogue, it would be nice to have open source alternatives.
