## üöÄ **Latest Model Release**

The zk0.bot SmolVLA Federated Learning model is now available on Hugging Face Hub!

- **Model**: [ivelin/zk0-smolvla-fl](https://huggingface.co/ivelin/zk0-smolvla-fl)
- **Training**: 30 rounds of federated learning with FedProx (Œº=0.01)
- **Final Policy Loss**: 0.544
- **Clients**: 4 clients on diverse SO-100 robotics tasks
- **Framework**: Flower + SmolVLA + SO-100 datasets

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoConfig
import torch

# Load the federated model
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("ivelin/zk0-smolvla-fl")
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("ivelin/zk0-smolvla-fl")

# Ready for robotics manipulation tasks!
```

## Why

AI technology has [advanced enough to speculate](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1786367513137233933) that within a decade most people will have their own humanoid buddy. By some estimates humanoids will become $100 Trillion market (5B humanoids * $20,000 per unit).

[Today's leading closed source humanoid](https://x.com/Tesla_Optimus/status/1846294753144361371) is trained on [100,000+ GPU farm](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus) with real world data collected from millions of cars labeled by able human drivers and a growing number of humanoid robot prototypes used in real world manufacturing environment. This is an enormous scale of compute and data that is hard to compete with as a centralized entity. However it would be interesting to see if a decentralized approach might produce useful results over time. On the chance that proprietary humanoids ever go rogue, it would be nice to have open source alternatives.

For more detailed contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## How

zk0 is composed of several major building blocks:

- Physical Embodiment:
  * Open Source 3D printed robot parts
  * Base 3D model so100 series from [HuggingFace LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot)
- Generative AI:
  * End-to-end Vision Language Action models.
  * Base SmolVLA model from [HuggingFace LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot)
- Federated Learning:
  * Distributed network of nodes contributing local data and training compute to a shared model.
  * FL framework: [Flower](https://flower.ai/)

## Roadmap

- Zero Knowledge Proofs that allow quick verification and data privacy:
  * Quickly verifiable proofs that an FL node is making meaningful contributions.
  * Frameworks under consideration:
    * [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1)
    * [EZKL](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl)
- Onchain contributor coordination
  * Immutable contribution history
  * Programmable network participation rules, incentives and project governance
  * Hosting blockchain: TBD

## Quick Start

For detailed setup, see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+, Conda, Git.
- NVIDIA GPU recommended.

### Clone and Setup

```shell
git clone <repository-url> .
cd zk0

# Create conda env
conda create -n zk0 python=3.10 -y
conda activate zk0
conda install ffmpeg=7.1.1 -c conda-forge

# Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Env vars
cp .env.example .env  # Edit as needed (e.g., HF_TOKEN)
```

### Run the Simulation

See [docs/RUNNING.md](docs/RUNNING.md) for full instructions.

```bash
# Quick test (1 round, serialized GPU)
./train.sh

# Full run (5 rounds)
conda run -n zk0 flwr run . local-simulation-serialized-gpu --run-config "num-server-rounds=5"

# Docker alternative
./train.sh --docker
```

- **Defaults**: 100 rounds, 10 clients, SO-100 datasets.
- **Outputs**: `outputs/<timestamp>/` with logs, metrics, charts (`eval_policy_loss_chart.png`), checkpoints (`.safetensors`), videos.

**Tested**: Completes 100 rounds in ~50s; policy loss tracks convergence.

## Repository Branches

- **main**: Stable releases. Use this for production setups and quick starts.
- **staging**: Final polish before merging with main. No new features. Only bug fixes and docs polish.
- **dev**: Active feature development. Pull requests should target dev. Clone or switch with `git checkout dev` for latest features (may be unstable).

## Project Status

### üöÄ Current Stage: Beta

Advanced development with core FL for SmolVLA on SO-100. Recent updates: Policy loss standardization, multi-repo partitioning, server eval.

#### Completed Milestones

- ‚úÖ Core Infrastructure: Flower 1.21.0 + Ray 2.31.0 + LeRobot 0.3.3.
- ‚úÖ Client Implementation: SmolVLA training, dataset partitioning.
- ‚úÖ Testing: 80%+ coverage, unit/integration suites.
- ‚úÖ CI/CD: GitHub Actions, auto-testing.
- ‚úÖ Config/Tooling: YAML datasets, env management.

#### In Progress

- Multi-task learning, advanced strategies (FedProx+), hyperparam tuning.
- ZK proofs, onchain coordination.

Full status: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#project-status). Baselines: [docs/TECHNICAL-OVERVIEW.md](docs/TECHNICAL-OVERVIEW.md#federated-vs-centralized-training-comparison).

**Config**: 4 clients (pickplace, stacking, etc.); 30+ rounds; policy loss metric.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! At this Beta stage, we're particularly interested in:

### Node Operators

If you have access to a LeRobot SO100 arm (or the newer SO101 version) and a local machine with an RTX 3090 GPU or better compatible with the LeRobot library, we'd love for you to join as a node operator. Your unique training data and compute resources will help improve the federated learning system.

### Code Contributors

We're also looking for developers to help with:
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- New feature development
- Testing and quality assurance
