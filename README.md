- **Final Policy Loss**: 0.495
- **Clients**: 4 clients on diverse SO-100 robotics tasks
- **Framework**: Flower + SmolVLA + SO-100 datasets
- **WandB Run**: [zk0-sim-fl-run-2025-10-20_23-44-35](https://wandb.ai/ivelin-eth/zk0/runs/zk0-sim-fl-run-2025-10-20_23-44-35)

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoConfig
import torch

# Load the federated model
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("ivelin/zk0-smolvla-fl")

# Ready for robotics manipulation tasks!
```

## Why

AI technology has [advanced enough to speculate](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1786367513137233933) that within a decade most people will have their own humanoid buddy. By some estimates humanoids will become $100 Trillion market (5B humanoids * $20,000 per unit).

[Today's leading closed source humanoid](https://x.com/Tesla_Optimus/status/1846294753144361371) is trained on [100,000+ GPU farm](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus) with real world data collected from millions of cars labeled by able human drivers and a growing number of humanoid robot prototypes used in real world manufacturing environment. This is an enormous scale of compute and data that is hard to compete with as a centralized entity. However it would be interesting to see if a decentralized approach might produce useful results over time. On the chance that proprietary humanoids ever go rogue, it would be nice to have open source alternatives.

For more detailed contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## How

zk0 is composed of several major building blocks:

- Physical Embodiment:
  * Open Source 3D printed robot parts
  * Base: 3D model so100 series from [HuggingFace LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot)
- Generative AI:
  * End-to-end Vision Language Action models.
  * Base: SmolVLA model from [HuggingFace LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot)
- Federated Learning:
  * Distributed network of nodes contributing local data and training compute to a shared model.
  * Base: [Flower FL framework](https://flower.ai/)

## Roadmap

- Zero Knowledge Proofs that allow quick verification and data privacy:
  * Quickly verifiable proofs that an FL node is making meaningful contributions.
  * Frameworks under consideration:
    * [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1)
    * [EZKL](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl)
- Onchain contributor coordination
  * Immutable contribution history
  * Programmable network participation rules, incentives and project governance
  * Hosting blockchain: TBD

## Quick Start

For detailed setup, see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+, Conda, Git.
- NVIDIA GPU recommended.

### Clone and Setup

```shell
git clone <repository-url> .
cd zk0

# Create conda env
conda create -n zk0 python=3.10 -y
conda activate zk0
conda install ffmpeg=7.1.1 -c conda-forge

# Install deps
pip install -e .

# Env vars
cp .env.example .env  # Edit as needed (e.g., HF_TOKEN)
```

### Run the Simulation

See [docs/RUNNING.md](docs/RUNNING.md) for full instructions.

```bash
# Quick test (1 round, serialized GPU)
./train.sh

# Full run (5 rounds)
conda run -n zk0 flwr run . local-simulation-serialized-gpu --run-config "num-server-rounds=5"

# Docker alternative
./train.sh --docker
```

### Push Model to Hugging Face Hub

After training, your model checkpoint will be automatically pushed to Hugging Face Hub as a complete checkpoint directory.
However if the training stops early for any reason, you can still push a saved intermediate checkpoint directory to HF Hub:

```bash
# Push model checkpoint directory to HF Hub
conda run -n zk0 python -m zk0.push_to_hf outputs/2025-10-09_13-59-05/models/checkpoint_round_30

# Push to custom repository
conda run -n zk0 python -m zk0.push_to_hf outputs/2025-10-09_13-59-05/models/checkpoint_round_30 --repo-id your-username/your-model
```


- **Defaults**: 500 rounds, 4 clients, SO-100/SO-101 datasets.
- **Outputs**: `outputs/<timestamp>/` with logs, metrics, charts (`eval_policy_loss_chart.png`), checkpoint directories, videos.
- **HF Hub Push**: For tiny/debug runs (e.g., `num-server-rounds < checkpoint_interval=20`), the final model push to Hugging Face Hub is skipped to avoid repository clutter with incomplete checkpoints. Local checkpoints are always saved. Full runs (‚â•20 rounds) will push to the configured `hf_repo_id`.

**Tested**: Completes 500 rounds in ~10-15 minutes; policy loss tracks convergence with early stopping.

## Repository Branches

- **main**: Stable releases. Use this for production setups and quick starts.
- **staging**: Final polish before merging with main. No new features. Only bug fixes and docs polish.
- **dev**: Active feature development. Pull requests should target dev. Clone or switch with `git checkout dev` for latest features (may be unstable).

## Project Status

### üöÄ Current Stage: Beta

Advanced development with core FL for SmolVLA on SO-100/SO-101. v0.3.11 updates: CI workflow consolidation with single matrix job for cleaner testing, lerobot CI fixes, Python 3.10 standardization, and removed redundant artifacts. Enhanced security with bidirectional SHA256 parameter validation between client and server. Consolidated metrics implementation for unified reporting.
